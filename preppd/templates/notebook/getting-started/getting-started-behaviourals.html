                            Case interviews, in short, are a portion of the interview often around 30 minutes in length,
                            in which you will work with your interviewer to analyze and solve different types of problems.
                            Oftentimes, these cases are of a business nature, although this can vary across firms and interview
                            rounds. Moreover, two styles of case delivery exist (interviewer led and interviewee led), further
                            expanding the scope of what you can expect come interview day. All of that said, it is important to
                            remember: Case interviews are designed and structured in such a way as to mimic the work you will do
                            as a consultant in the industry, as best as can be done in a 30 minute exercise, and just as is true
                            in the job, there will never be a single “right way” or “right approach.” In fact, case interviews
                            are designed to suss out your intrinsic abilities as a prospective consultant, not your business
                            knowledge or ability to memorize and apply standard approaches. So let’s dive in.</br></br>

                            <h4>The two styles of cases</h4>


                            <h4>The CARL</h4>

                            Online you can find thousands of consulting behavioural questions to practice with and
                            to help you get comfortable with what you can expect. One common mistake is to memorize
                            answers to these in advance and practice sounding unscripted – this should be avoided at all
                            costs. Personally, I think there are two common, and acceptable, ways of going about preparing
                            for this portion of the interview:
                            1. Question-first approach: Typically this takes form of a large spreadsheet or word
                            doc, in which people will list out all of the questions (or types of questions) they
                            think they may get. For example, each column might be something like “Tell me
                            about a time when you demonstrated leadership in a team” or “Leadership
                            experience.” From there, you can write down all of the things that you could draw
                            on for a good answer and order them best-worst.
                            2. Answer-first approach (my preference): This approach starts at the other end, which
                            is typically a full version of your resume (by full I mean add back all of the relevant
                            experiences/positions that you cut off for space or whatever). From there, spend
                            some time thinking about each one, and the experiences you had/skills you utilized
                            or built upon. And then you can just choose whichever best fits the question you’re
                            asked. I like this method because it ensures you nearly always have something to
                            say since you can simply tailor an answer to the given question, whereas in the
                            question-first approach if you are asked a different question than you practiced, you
                            are forced to wing it!
                            Regardless of which you prefer, it is best to think about the stories you can draw on
                            from each experience in advance. Again, this doesn’t mean you should memorize them. But
                            you should think through all the “times you dealt with a difficult team member and how you
                            overcame it,” etc. so that you have more to talk about than just explaining your role, for
                            example.
                            Once you get comfortable with your resume, and you’ve stepped back to look at the
                            holistic picture of your experiences and what it means in a consulting interview context, all you
                            can do is practice with yourself (film yourself, don’t trust a mirror) or practice with other people.
                            Just don’t over practice or you will sound scripted and it will negatively impact you.
                            The last thing I’ll mention on the behaviourals is that they do vary by firm and by round:
                             CREO Solutions | 2018-2019 Management Consulting Recruiting Guide
                            5
                            Most firms (excluding McKinsey) will typically ask 2-3 questions in first round (tell me
                            about a time you demonstrated leadership, tell me about a time you changed someone’s mind,
                            tell me about a time you had to work in a difficult team environment, etc.), taking up ~15-20
                            minutes. McKinsey’s first round, however, is only 1 behavioural question based on either
                            entrepreneurial spirit (drive) or leadership and lasts for ~20 minutes. Instead of asking a series
                            of questions, they spend the entire time probing into the 1 story you have told (why did you
                            make that decision, what were you thinking at that time, what do you think the other person
                            was thinking when you did that, etc.). This is because they are looking for exceptionally specific
                            things, so listen carefully to their questions!
                            Second rounds at any firm are more of a wild card as Partners will ask you whatever
                            they feel like and it is nearly impossible to predict what you will be faced with. I’ve heard of
                            people having a traditional case + standard behavioural interview, having an interview that was
                            really just an hour long conversation about a topic they find interesting, and even people being
                            told to act out different scenarios! Either way, second round interviews tend to be much less
                            structured as first round is asking the question can you do the job and second round is asking
                            the question do I want to staff you on my team, which may look different for different people.


                            <h4>Some example behavioural questions</h4>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership under a tight time constraint</li>
                              <li>Tell me about a time you worked with a team through a difficult situation?</li>
                              <li>Tell me about a time when you had to had to change someone’s mind about something?</li>
                              <li>What gets you up in the morning?</li>
                              <li>What are you most proud of on your resume?</li>
                              <li>Why do you want to work for [firm]?</li>
                              <li>Tell me about a time you were motivated to take initiative / start something?</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>What we 'wish we knew'</h4>
                            <ul>
                              <li>If possible, avoid talking about academic stories (when asked about a difficult
                              team situation, for example) and focus on professional (work) or extracurricular experience.
                              Academic stories tend to seem more surface level, and given everyone has gone through such
                              experiences, it won't differentiate you from other candidates as much.</li>
                              <li>Try to think of stories that have a more substance to them: it is quite common for
                              interviewers to probe with follow up questions, sometimes for a long time.</li>
                              <li>Try not to repeat stories within the same round, even if you are asked similar things.
                              This advice is particularly important for firms like McKinsey that choose one experience
                              and go into great depth, though it is preferred elsewhere, too. One workaround if you
                              are limited on stories is to use the same position, but choose a different story to tell
                              about it. This is because your interviewers will get in a room and discuss your performance,
                              and if you use the same exact stories, you risk making them think you only have those
                              experiences in your toolkit.</li>
                              <li>Again, use the CARL framework when answering behavioural questions at any firm. It will
                              help keep you structured and concise, and it gives them exactly what they are looking for.</li>
                              <li>Although it is important to be humble, focus on what <em>you</em> did in your responses.
                              Remember: they are evaluating whether or not to hire you, not your team!</li>
