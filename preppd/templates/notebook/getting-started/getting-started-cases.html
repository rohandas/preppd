                          <p>Case interviews, in short, are a portion of the interview often around 30 minutes in length, in which you will work with your interviewer to analyze and solve different types of problems. Oftentimes, these cases are of a business nature, although this can vary across firms and interview rounds. Moreover, two styles of case delivery exist (interviewer led and interviewee led), further expanding the scope of what you can expect come interview day. All of that said, it is important to remember: Case interviews are designed and structured in such a way as to mimic the work you will do as a consultant in the industry, as best as can be done in a 30 minute exercise, and just as is true in the job, there will never be a single “right way” or “right approach.” In fact, case interviews are designed to suss out your intrinsic abilities as a prospective consultant, not your business knowledge or ability to memorize and apply standard approaches. So let’s dive in.</br></br></p>
                            <h4>The two styles of cases</h4>
                            <p>There are two styles of cases you can expect to get in your interviews – not in the content, but in the process and structure. Specifically, there are <em>interviewer </em>led cases and <em>interviewee </em>led cases. Although there will be a “back-and-forth” dynamic in both styles, the way in which you approach and work through these two styles is quite different.</br></p>
                            <b>Interviewer led cases</b>
                            <p><i>Interviewer led cases, as the name implies, are directed by the interviewer. Notably, the interviewer will give you the general case context and then have you work on specific problems, often disregarding the natural flow of the case. Candidates often describe this as feeling more like question and answer format, with the interviewer asking one question after another, without necessarily directly linking from one to the next. One benefit of this style is that your answers for each question won’t hinder the direction of the rest of the case, as compared to an interviewee led case in which your answer can shape the rest of the case significantly. On the flipside, interviewer led cases often require higher creativity, intuition and intellect to do an exceptional job.</i></p>
                            <b>Interviewee led cases</b>
                            <p><i>On the other hand, interviewee led cases are directed by you. Generally, the interviewer will open in a similar way with the general case context, after which you will provide an opening structure to frame your response. Then it will be your responsibility to lead the direction of the interview, by asking for data or asking clarifying questions, drawing conclusions from what you find, and working to refine your answer until you feel comfortable providing a concluding recommendation.</i></br></p>
                            <p>One important note: The intrinsics required for both types of cases are quite similar, so, although you may feel or hear that these two styles are different, the main factor for your success will be whether you can successfully structure and work through problems effectively. As such, although it is good to practice both types of cases, being able to work through each component of the case well will give you basically everything you need to ace your cases – the rest will come down to trying each a few times to get the hang of them.</br></br></p>
                            <h4>The flow and components of a case</h4>
                            <p>
                              In general, cases have four stages. The following modules on this page will dive into what to expect in each one, as well as how to go about working through each. In this section, we will just introduce the four basic components and what they mean for you:
                              <ul>
                                <li><b>Case opening:</b> Every case will begin with some kind of case prompt. Oftentimes this will be 30-90 seconds long, and your interviewer will give you general context about the situation you will be working through with them. Once they complete reading you
                                the case prompt, you will have the opportunity to ask clarifying questions. In general it is best to keep questions to a minimum at this point unless there is something you misunderstood, or need to know critically. If you didn't catch something they said, or
                                didn't understand, though, now is the time to ask.</li>
                                <li><b>Case structuring:</b> After they have given you the case prompt, whether it is an interviewer led case or an interviewee led case, the first step will be to come up with a structure with which you feel you can disect the problem into meaningful chunks.
                                This step is where frameworks, issue trees, and the like come into play for those of you who have come across these concepts. In short, your main goal is to create some kind of framework that will enable you to address the most relevant aspects of the
                                situation at hand, and eventually, use the information pertaining to each oen to develop recommendations.</li>
                                <li><b>Problem solving and analysis:</b> After you talk through your case structure, you will find yourself in the 'meat' of the case. In an interviewer led case, your interviewer will likely decide where the case should go next. In an interviewee led case,
                                you will have to ask probing questions to get any further information you feel may be relevant, but, you will do so using your structure, starting with the items you feel will be most important to figure out and going down the list. As you move through this,
                                whether by your own volition or your interviewer's, you will be presented with various pieces of information that you will have to work through. These may be quantitative or qualitative, and may include exhibits to provide you with relevant information.
                                As you work through this, it will be important for you to keep in mind what you are working toward: an answer to the case you are trying to solve. Anything else can be more or less disregarded.</li>
                                <li><b>Conclusions and recommendations:</b> Last but not least, you will likely be asked to conclude the case by providing a recommendation. Although later content in this section will discuss how to do so most effectively, this is the part of the case where
                                you will take everything you've done, summarize it into a set of relevant recommendations, and likely also risks or other considerations, and present it back to your interviewer - the culmination of all you have done.</li>
                              </ul>
                              </br>
                              <img src="{% static 'images/Case-flow.jpg' %}" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></br></br>
                            </p>
                            <h4>What we 'wish we knew'</h4>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Don’t be afraid to ask for time for more difficult or involved questions like the structuring components. If your interviewer wants you to dive in, and you won’t be docked marks for asking (although you could be for having a fragmented or incomplete response</li>
                              <li>You only get credit for what you say out loud, so vocalize your thoughts and assumptions, within reason. Remember: You may know how smart you are, as may your case buddies, but your interviewers aren’t mind readers and having just met you, the burden will be on you to show them how you think different types of problems, as well as how and why you work through them the way you do</li>
                              <li>The best interviews are ones where it doesn’t feel one-directional: Your interviewer wants to feel included in your process, so think of the interview more as a problem-solving session than a verbal exam and you will be better off for it</li>
                              <li>Cases can go in many directions. There are countless cases we’ve given or been given where two candidates with the same interview will say entirely different answers and still receive offers</li>
                              <li>It is OK to get stuck; and it is OK to make mistakes. People often hear that you have to do the case perfectly from start to finish. The problem is, perfection is subjective and impossible, especially in the context of a case interview. If you get stuck, make sure to explain what you’re thinking, why you’re thinking that, and where the gap is for you. If you make a mistake, interviewers also may ask you similar questions to allow you to redeem yourself whether you realize it or not. So, regardless of what happens, stay calm and collected, do what you can, remember that your interviewer is there to help you succeed and wants you to, and the rest will work itself out!</li>
                            </ul>
                          </div>

                        <div class="step-pane" id="step2">
                          <p>In starting your case interview, your interviewer will provide the "prompt" for the case you will be working through. Oftentimes this will be 30-90
                            seconds long, over which time you will be given general context about the opportunity or problem at hand. Case prompts can at time be as short as 1-2
                            sentences, although this is more common for final round interviews (some examples for both first round and final round case promts below). When your
                            interviewer has finished telling you the prompt, you can ask any clarifying questions you may have - oftentimes they will explicitly offer - however,
                            it is best to prioritize things you don't understand or didn't catch. For example, if the case is on Oil & Gas and you don't know enough about the
                            problem presented to even begin structuring it, you could ask if the interviewer could provide a brief overview of how the industry works or what
                            certain terminology they used means.
                          </br></br></p>

                          <h4>How to start your case off well</h4>
                          <p>As a starting point, make sure that you bring some blank or graph paper (your preference) and at least one working pen. Oftentimes, candidates will
                            also number their pages before the interview to help them stay organized. As you may use many pieces of paper over the course of the case, it is not
                            uncommon to do this. Moreover, some candidates will structure their page to help stay organized. Below is one example we find particularly useful:</br>
                            <img src="{% static 'images/Case-opening-page.jpg' %}" style="margin: 10px; width: 30%; height: 30%">
                            <ol>
                              <li><b>Problem statement:</b> Once you have heard the whole case prompt, it can be beneficial to write a one sentence summary of the 'problem at hand.' This often helps candidates remain focused on what matters, and gives them an easy way to refer back to it throughout the case</li>
                              <li><b>Notes:</b> As the interviewer reads the case prompt, the notes section can be used to jot down relevant information. This may include facts about the client, the industry, or otherwise</li>
                              <li><b>Structure:</b> Based on the problem you are trying to solve, you can write your structure to the write, rounding out your first page and letting you easily walk your interviewer through your thinking</li>
                            </ol>
                          </br></p>

                          <h4>Some example case prompts</h4>
                          <em>First round</em>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Let’s assume our client is a global soft drinks and beverage products producer who manufactures and sells hundreds of brands, from soft drinks to juices to vitamin waters and more. Over the last little while, competing positive and negative pressures have started to concern the CEO.
                              In particular, global demand for sugar, particularly in large markets like India has started to decline, which he worries is due to health concerns that may impact many of their products. On the flipside, they are the world’s largest buyer of sugar at 15% globally, and because sugar
                              prices are falling, it may give them an advantage to offer sugar-based drinks due to cost. The CEO isn’t sure if he should be concerned or not, but wants to maintain their strong global position as a market leader and needs help thinking through how to do so.</li>
                            <li>As the world becomes increasingly global in nature, the number of flights taken every year is increasing quickly. Transport systems, and in particular larger airports, designed in the 70s and 80s, find themselves struggling to meet passenger needs due to inefficient operations and bottlenecks throughout various processes. We have been brought in by the US government to help remedy operational concerns in Watersmith Falls, Oregon. Watersmith Falls hosts one airport, the world’s largest airport, which currently receives about 1,500 flights of passengers a day. John Langdon, Minister of Transportation, has asked us to look into how Watersmith Falls may be able to process more incoming passengers as well as more outgoing passengers, and do so more quickly. John mentioned that there is a budget in place for infrastructural development and improvement, but also that interruptions to existing service would also need to be considered. How would you think about approaching the problem of increasing a city’s capacity to receive and send passengers nationally and internationally?</li>
                            <li>Our client is a private equity firm in Brazil who is considering purchasing a Mexican beer manufacturer who distributes throughout North and South America. The target company, Bargain Barley, specializes in the low price, moderate quality beer segment, targeting casual drinkers. What would you want to know before advising your client to buy (or not) BrewCo?</li>
                          </ul>
                          <em>Final round (could be similar to first round or like the below)</em>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Beyonce has been asked to perform at the Super Bowl half time show, but the League believes in return for the benefit of getting to perform, she should not be paid any ticket revenue, and should cover her performance costs. Should she do it?</li>
                            <li>You're building a new country. Where should you start?</li>
                            <li>You've been serving the CEO of a large company for 5 years, and through a comprehensive analysis you come to find that he is actually the main source of declining morale and profitability. Pretend I am the CEO, and that we are going to discuss what has to happen now to turn the company around. Go ahead.</li>

                          <p>In this portion of the case, you will be asked to work through a question of a more quantiative nature. This will often take one of

                          <h4 style="color:red">TO BE WRITTEN</h4>

                        <p> In this portion of the interview, they will ask you a question of a more qualitative nature. These questions are predominantly one
                          of two formats: analysis of a qualitative exhibit, or ideation and brainstorming around a given topic.</br></p>
                        <h4>Ideation questions</h4>
                        <p>Ideation questions are used to evaluate your ability to think conceptually and creatively; although they will not have a quantitative
                          nature to them, do not underestimate the importance of this type of question: They are equally important as the other parts of the case
                          and may come more naturally but are important to be ready for. Typically, ideation components will ask you to brainstorm a list of
                          items such as potential reasons for an observed outcome (e.g., why could their market share be declining) or a way through which
                          you could go about conducting an analysis you imply could be useful.</br></br>Like other elements of the case, the best way to prepare
                          is to practice doing questions of this nature (which is why we have provided you the <b>Ideation</b> case module). Although oftentimes
                          these questions require the context of the case to be able to answer properly, some abstracted examples of questions  we have seen used
                          in interviews include:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Regulatory changes in the country will restrict your client from selling their product (alcohol) in grocery stores, and instead,
                            only in state-controlled alcohol stores. How would you analyze the implications of this change?</li>
                            <li>The client (a shoe retailer) projects that their revenue growth will shrink from 25% per year to 10% per year over the coming year,
                            and may be at risk of further compression. What would you suggest they condsider to bolster revenue growth again, rapidly?</li>
                            <li>Your client (a publicly-funded national hospital network) has been asked by the government to bring in physiotherapy and
                            chiropractic services to all hospital locations in the next 5 years. They are considering either buying local, independent medical
                            practices, or building the capability themselves in-house. What would be the major pros and cons of each option?</li>
                            <li>Pressure from Netflix and other forms of entertainment are significantly hindering your client's (a TV network) ability to
                            make money from selling advertising, as viewership declines. What should they consider to combat this downward pressure on their
                            revenues?</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Qualitative exhibits</h4>
                        <p>Qualitative exhibits are also used to evaluate your ability to think conceptually and creatively, and may either be given to you
                           with a specific question to answer (interviewer led), or given to you once you have asked for relevant information (interviewee led)
                           from which is will be on you to deduce what you want from it. These exhibits will vary more in nature than quantitative ones, as they
                           can be crafted to respresent anything the case-writer desires, and in any form they see fit. With that, these exhibits will often draw
                           more on your intuition than logic and reasoning.</br></br>Similar to ideation questions, you will need to deduce or hypothesize some
                           conclusions from the exhibit you are presented. Again, as a mechanism for you to understand what exhibits like this will require,
                           we are including a representative shortlist from exhibit questions we have seen used in interviewer led interviews:
                           <ul>
                             <li>Based on this exhibit of consumer perceptions for each of our products on price, performance and durability, what hypotheses
                             do you have about how our client should change their product portfolio to capture more market share?</li>
                             <li>What can you conclude from the exhibit with respect to whether our client is well-positioned to expand into grocery stores?</li>
                             <li>What hypotheses do you have about how our client's B2B customers perceive their offering relative to competitors?</li>
                           </ul>
                         </p>
                        <h4>What we 'wish we knew'</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Always ask to take time to structure your thoughts. It’s much better to spend 30 seconds down your top ~3-5 ideas than to sacrifice
                          depth of thought, structure, and clarity, which often happens when candidates rush and list things off on the fly. If for some reason
                          your interviewer decides they want you to brainstorm live, they will just say 'no' or tell you this, and will then factor that into their
                          judgement of your answer. However, generally speaking they will let you have the time you need (within reason)</li>
                          <li>When possible, lead with your best answers or ideas. In fact, if there are clear forerunners in your mind, tell your interviewers you
                            think this, and why, as it will bolster their impression of how you are thinking about the problem so long as your logic is sound</li>
                          <li>Add colour to your answers by thinking creatively, explaining the rational and logic you are using, and giving real life parallels.
                            Remember: They are largely evaluating your ability to think creatively and deeply in this stage of the case. By drawing parallels to real-life
                            as discussed above, it will show that you are thinking about the problem as more than a tick-the-box interview exercise</li>
                          <li>Don’t be thrown off if they ask “is there anything else?” or ask probing questions into your ideas (e.g. what piece of analysis would you
                            do to get that information?, what are some of the potential issues with that idea?, what do you think that idea would do to help solve the
                            problem?) They use such questions to test your logic and dig deeper into your thought process</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step-pane" id="step6">
                          <p>Although it isn't a type of question per se, often, reading exhibits are a helpful thing to get comfortable doing,
                            especially if you haven't spent time doing so in a job to date. Exhibits can appear in different forms throughout
                          the case process. You may be faced with an exhibit in a qualitative question and/or a quantitative question, or it
                          may be a totally separate component of the case all together for one of two reasons: 1) To give you general information
                          you may use for context or recommendation development implicitly; or 2) To evaluate your ability to read and interpret
                          exhibits as a separate question. Either way, it is highly likely you will be shown at least one exhibit per case, and
                          it is your job to interpret the information presented, synthesize it, and interpret / incorporate relevant conclusions.</br></p>
                          <h4>Common types of exhibits</h4>
                          <p>There are a number of common exhibits. One often underutilized consideration is that they 90-100% of the exhibits you see will
                            be created in either Excel or Think-Cell. If you are unfamiliar with either, both are very common tools in consulting for analysis
                            and insight generation. As such, most exhibits will be created from standard outputs as such. A full list of ThinkCell charting
                            functionality can conveniently <u><a href="https://www.think-cell.com/en/product/features.shtml">be found here</a></u>. Do take the time
                            to read up on the charts that are unfamiliar to you.</br> In terms of frequency of seeing these in interviews, a rough estimate would
                            be as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Most common:</b> Stacked column / bar, waterfall, mekko, line</li>
                              <li><b>Relatively common:</b> Pie, scatter, bubble</li>
                              <li><b>Somewhat common:</b> Area 100%, clustered, gantt</li>
                              <li><b>Relatively uncommon:</b> Area, 100%, butterfly</li>
                            </ul>
                          <h4>What we 'wish we knew'</h4>
                          <ul>
                            <li>As previously recommended, don't be afraid to ask for time to review the exhibit. You will likely come up with immediate
                              conclusions within 10-20 seconds, however, these are <em>first-order</em> insights, and though valuable, they often of lesser
                              interest. More often than not, there are usually deeper insights you can draw (you should strive for second- and third-order
                              thinking in order to really excel in this component. This will only be possible if you spend an extra 20-30 seconds digesting
                              the information</li>
                            <li>When talking through your insights, begin by briefly explaining your understanding of the chart (what it represents and what
                              the axes are). This not only ensures you are understanding the graph correctly, but it allows you to solidify your thoughts and
                              messaging before answering! Following this, make sure to talk through your conclusions in a structured and logical way - if it
                              feels to your interviewer like you're making things up as you go, or it is a hard-to-follow laundry list of ideas, you'll be
                              disadvantaged in your performance here</li>
                            <li>Review ThinkCell and Excel as resourcse here. You may be faced with creative exhibits you haven’t seen before, but more often
                              than not, case interview exhibits are made on one of these two softwares. If you familiarize yourself with the graph options on
                              each, you will be much more prepared than most other candidates and have a less strenuous time reading each chart</li>
                            <li>Always ask if you are allowed to mark up the paper before you do</li>
                            <li>For how to respond to the actual question (qualitative or quantitative), see above sections as it will not vary too much from
                              a regular qual/quant approach</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step-pane" id="step7">
                          <p>The last part of the case, though not always gauranteed to exist, is the recommendations and conclusions section. In interviewer led
                          cases, this will be a part of ~75-85% of cases, and will often be presented at the end of a case with your interviewer saying something
                          like "You run into the CEO on your way to a team dinner and she asks you how everything is going with the project, what you've found so
                          far, and what your emmerging recommendations are. What do you tell her?" In interviewee led cases, your interviewer may more explicitly
                          ask you for a recommendation and conclusion, or less often but not uncommon, when you have worked through a sufficient amount of the case
                          and think you have enough of what you need to make a reasonable and factually sound recommendation, you can suggest concluding. However,
                          if you feel as though the interviewer wants you to continue, or you think there is more information you have yet to uncover, it is wise
                          to continue probing as previously mentioned.</br></br></p>

                          <h4>Wrapping up your case smoothly</h4>
                          <p>Regarless of how the conclusion is induced, it is important to have a thoughtful and structured answer. At this point unless explicitly
                          asked in the prompt not to, it is a good idea to ask for a minute to prepare your thoughts. It is important to note that some interviewers
                          will ask you to start anyway: this is mostly a matter of personal preference for them, and by asking you are doing no wrong, so it in always
                          better to do so. Although everyone has their own preference for how to present conclusions and recommendations, we strongly believe in a
                          simple three-step approach:
                            <ol>
                              <li><b>Frame:</b> Reiterate the problem statement (what you are trying to solve) and very briefly the process you have followed to get to an
                                answer. This should in total be no more than 2 sentences.</li>
                              <li><b>Recommend:</b> Provide your recommendations in a logical manner. Oftentiems it is best to open by explaining something along these lines:
                                "From this I have developed X recommendations, of which the first will be most important for helping client Y do Z. First, I suggest
                                that they..." Take the time to explain your high-level rational along with the relevance and importance of each recommedation. If
                                relevant, you can also consider providing a brief explanation of how the recommendation may be implemented.</li>
                              <li><b>Caveat and close:</b> After presenting the above, you should aim to be not much over the 1 minute mark, but still, it is important to
                                caveat your answer to show that you are thinking about the problem holistically given that this case will have only been 15-25 minute of
                                analysis. Oftentimes, strong candidates will say something like "With more time I also feel that it would be important to dig deeper into two
                                areas in order to get fully comfortable with the recommendations presented. First..." By explaining what limitations you see with your answer
                                you hedge yourself from the fact that your interviewer may see the problem or solution differently than you, and more, it will show them that
                                regardless of your differences of opinion, you are thinking soundly about the problem and would be able to continue working forward in a real
                                project.</li>
                            </ol>
