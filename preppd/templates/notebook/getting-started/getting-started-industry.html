                          <p>Consulting is a broad term and depending on the context you use it in, it can mean very different things.
                            For this guide, and most pertinent to your recruiting (most likely), we will be talking about management
                            consulting. That being said, we will call out if there are any areas that are not relevant to other types
                            of consulting. Specific types of consulting like IT consulting, for example, may have a more narrow problem
                            and solution scope, however, the recruiting process and interviews will generally be similar enough that Prepp'd
                            will still help you prepare.</br></br>This section will be brief, and at the most general level you may already
                            know some of this/ However, we feel it is important to build a fundamental understanding of the industry which
                            you can build on over time, through Prepp'd resources, discussions with consultants in industry, and reading
                            As a starting point, we will present here enough information so you are comfortable with how the industry, and
                            the firms in it, operate – and why they operate the way they do.</br></br>The consulting industry is broken into
                            a few different informal segments. First are the "elites,” the more pure management consultancies. Most prominent
                            in brand are McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain, oft-referred to by their acronym "MBB." Other
                            relevant and prominent firms with management consulting businesses are Monitor (now Monitor-Deloitte after being
                            acquired), Oliver Wyman, Accenture, and A.T. Kearny, among others.</br></br>
                            <div style="width:70%; margin:auto">
                              <img style="width:50%" src="{% static 'images/getting-started-firms1.jpg' %}"/>
                              <img style="width:40%" src="{% static 'images/getting-started-firms2.jpg' %}"/>
                            </div>

                            </br></br>The big four accounting firms also
                            operate in the space through their 'advisory' practices. Over time, regulation has required different levels of
                            separation between consulting and accounting businesses: in the late 1990s and early 2000, for example, accounting
                            firms had to divest of their consulting businesses because of conflicts of interest. However, over the past several
                            yearsthey have been buying up consulting firms at pace: Deloitte bought Monitor; KPMG bought Secor; and PwC bought
                            Booz & Co.</br></br>
                            <img style="width:30%; display:block; margin:auto" src="{% static 'images/getting-started-firms3.jpg' %}"/>

                            </br></br>
                            Lastly, you have the boutiques which typically have a specialty of some sort – but these firms
                            do not act as management consulting firms so much as specialty advisors, often on topics like HR, analytics or IT.

                          <p>Everyone has a different reason for considering consulting as a career option, and chances are, if you're on this
                            page, you've at least done some preliminary thinking about why you might choose it too.

                            Each firm has a very different brand, culture, set of values, focus/emphasis on supporting its employees in different
                            ways, etc. Moreover, these are things that can change over time and vary significantly even across geographies or
                            offices. As such it will be up to you to decide which firm is the best fit for you for when you have, hopefully, to
                            decide between different offers. As well as the information presented in the previous section, we would recommend
                            that you do two things. First is to continue doing research online and reading media publications / forums that reference
                            firms you are considering. Second, and far more valuable, is to start having discussions as early as possible with summer
                            and full-time employees at firms you’re considering applying to. Through those chats you can begin discussing the kinds of
                            things that matter to you, which may include things like:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>What the career trajectory looks like in terms of timing, responsibility, and otherwise as you are promoted</li>
                              <li>What mentorship efforts look like formally or informally</li>
                              <li>To what degree you can decide your travel, or exert influence of the types of work you'll be doing</li>
                              <li>Typical working weeks (including hours per day, weekends, and flexibility options like working from home)</li>
                              <li>What the office social-life and social culture are like</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                            Once you have a good handle on the 'basics' of a given firm, like those listed above, ask questions that require deeper
                            answers from the other side too, such as their project work, their path at the firm, or other interesting questions you
                            may be genuinely curious to hear the answer to! Remember that coffee chats are not only an opportunity for the firm to
                            get to know you, but vice versa! We will touch more on this in the <b>Setting yourself up for success</b> section later
                            on.</br></p>
